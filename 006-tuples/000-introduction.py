"""
Tuples are...

read-only lists... at least that's how many introductions to Python will present tuples

This isn't wrong, but there's a lot more going on with tuples...

If you only think of tuples as read-only lists, you're going to miss out on some interesting ideas

Just as a string is more than just a list of characters

We really need to think of tuples also as data records: the position of each value has meaning

This is why we are going to start looking at tuples before we even cover sequence types

We are going to focus here on tuples as **data records** or **structures**

We will also look at **named tuples**
