"""
First-Class Objects
- can be passed to a function as an argument
- can be returned from a function
- can be assigned to a variable
- can be stored in a data structure (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, etc.)

Higher-Order Functions
Higher-order functions are functions that:
- take a function as an argument (e.g. the simple timer we wrote in the last section)
- and/or *return* a function (plenty of that when we cover decorators in the next section)
